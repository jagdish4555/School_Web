School is a platform for the art in children to come out. The students of our school are very ahead in various art fields and cultural activities. And the main reason for this is that the art in the students is brought out through various cultural activities in the school. Under the cultural activities, various competitions and games are properly coordinated and the strengths of the students are brought out. Children who may be a little weak in studies but are ahead in other activities or fields are sent in that direction. The principal and teachers of the school also give a lot of encouragement to the students in this regard.
